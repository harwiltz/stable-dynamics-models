# Stable Dynamics Models
![](https://github.com/harwiltz/stable-dynamics-models/workflows/Python%203.7%20Test/badge.svg)

This repo contains an implementation of the method introduced in ["Learning Stable Deep Dynamics
Models"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9292-learning-stable-deep-dynamics-models) with PyTorch. This
includes a PyTorch implementation of an [Input Convex Neural
Network](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/amos17b/amos17b.pdf).

The goal with this repo is to extend the results to account for controlled systems.
